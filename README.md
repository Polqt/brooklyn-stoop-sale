# Track 2: Brooklyn Stoop Sale (React + Vite)

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Objectives

- To invite people around Brooklyn or other nearby cities to a Brooklyn Stoop Sale

## Description

- The stoop sale is organized by Chelsea and Lil

- Possible motto to use or message: Your trash is someone else treasure

- Location: Carroll Gardens, at the corner of Court Street and 2nd Ave.

- The goal is to attract attendees from South Brooklyn and beyond.
